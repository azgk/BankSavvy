Personal EOM

Do you (and your spouse or other family members) have too many
credit cards to keep track of? Do you toggle between banks in the wizarding world and banks in the muggle society?
Personal EOM (End of Month) can crunch the numbers for you.  

To use, simply drop your bank transaction csv files into "**csv_files-->Deposits**" or "**csv_files-->Expenses**" folder. (If a file includes both deposits and expenses, drop it in both
"Expenses" and "Deposits" folders.) Then enter your bank account info in main.py. Run the program and you will 
see how much you earned and spent for the given month.
